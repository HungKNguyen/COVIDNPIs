Data Analysis for COVID NPIs effectiveness

This research paper as part of the class Advanced Econometrics at Lawrence University. I processed data from Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) using RStudio.

Abstract:
This paper examines the effect of various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that governments utilized to reduce Covid-19 spread. This paper serves to differentiate between NPIs that work versus those that do not and can inform policymakers in the continuing fight against Covid-19 or future pandemics. Data were compiled from 36 countries from April 2020 to October 2021. Policy effectiveness was measured by the reduction of the Covid-19 reproduction rate, using lagged first-difference estimates. We found evidence to support policies such as school closing, workplace closing, limitation on gathering, limitation on domestic and international travels, debt relief, increase testing availability, facial covering mandate, and elder protection policies. We found no evidence to suggest policies such as stay-at-home mandate and contact tracing to be effective. There is some evidence for policies' complementary effect and substitution effect.
